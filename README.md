## üåü Overview

**Celebrity Face Matcher** revolutionizes the way we connect with celebrity culture. Through advanced AI algorithms and vector search technology, we create meaningful connections between everyday faces and their celebrity counterparts.

## üéØ Vision

> _"In every face lies a story waiting to be told through the lens of stardom."_

Our mission is to:
- **Empower Individuality**: Show users that every face is unique and special.
- **Boost Self-Confidence**: Help users see themselves as the stars they are.
- **Democratize Celebrity Culture**: Break traditional barriers by demonstrating that anyone can resemble a celebrity.
- **Enable Real-Time Storytelling**: Transform everyday images into interactive, cinematic narratives.
- **Explain the Match**: Provide in-depth, technical explanations of why the system believes a particular celebrity is a match.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12+**: The primary programming language.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
     - **MTCNN**: For robust face detection and landmark extraction.
     - **InceptionResnetV1**: A CNN trained on **VGGFace2** that generates a 512-dimensional facial embedding.
     - **CLIP**: Trained on millions of image-text pairs, this model learns a shared embedding space.
- **Vector Database**:
     - **Pinecone**: A managed vector database that stores high-dimensional embeddings.
- **Database**:
     - **MongoDB Atlas**: Stores celebrity metadata and image paths from the CelebA dataset.
- **APIs and Tools**:
     - **Kaggle API**: For downloading the CelebA dataset.
     - **PyTorch**: For model inference.
     - **Hugging Face InferenceClient**: Powers our LLM (e.g., Mistral-7B) which generates natural language explanations.
- **Other Libraries**:
     - **OpenCV**: For image processing and visualization.
     - **Pandas**: For CSV processing.
     - **dotenv**: For environment variable management.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Pipeline

The project is organized into several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
      - The `app/data/celeba_ingestion.py` module downloads a subset of the CelebA dataset using the Kaggle API, processes the CSV files, and stores celebrity records in MongoDB.

2. **Image Processing Pipeline**:
      - **Face Detection & Alignment (MTCNN)**: Detects faces and extracts facial landmarks, then aligns the face into a canonical view.
      - **Embedding Extraction (InceptionResnetV1)**: Generates a robust 512-dimensional embedding capturing facial features.
      - **Pipeline Orchestration**: Integrates detection, alignment, and encoding, generating composite images that juxtapose the query image with its best match.

3. **Vector Storage & Retrieval**:
      - **Pinecone Vector Database**: Manages the index containing over 10,000 precomputed celebrity embeddings, using ANN search with cosine similarity to retrieve the most similar embeddings.

4. **Query & Inference**:
      - **Query Pipeline**: Processes a user-uploaded image through the entire pipeline and queries Pinecone to retrieve top matches.
      - **LLM Explanation Module**: Uses **CLIP** to generate captions and a Hugging Face LLM to generate a detailed explanation of the match.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Pinecone account
- Kaggle account

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/maxhartml/Celebrity-Face-Matcher.git
      cd Celebrity-Face-Matcher
      ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
      ```sh
      python -m venv env
      source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
      ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
      Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
      ```env
      # MongoDB
      MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      MONGODB_DB_NAME=celebrityDB
      MONGODB_COLLECTION=celebrities

      # Pinecone
      PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
      PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=celebrity-embeddings
      PINECONE_CLOUD=aws
      PINECONE_REGION=us-east-1

      # HuggingFace
      HF_API_TOKEN=your_hf_api_totken
      ```

5. **Set Up Kaggle Credentials**:
      Follow Kaggle‚Äôs instructions to place your `kaggle.json` file in `~/.kaggle/` or set the `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

## üöÄ Usage

### Data Ingestion

To download and ingest a subset of the CelebA dataset into MongoDB, run:
```sh
python -m app.data.celeba_ingestion
```

### Running the Image Processing Pipeline

To process all celebrity records from the database, extract their embeddings, and store them in Pinecone, run:
```sh
python -m app.orchestration.orchestrator
```

### Querying the Pinecone Index & Running the Streamlit UI

To query the Pinecone index with an image and view the results via a user-friendly interface:

1. Launch the Streamlit UI:

     ```sh
     streamlit run streamlit_app.py
     ```
