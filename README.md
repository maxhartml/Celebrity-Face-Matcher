# üåü Celebrity Face Matcher üåü

Welcome to **Celebrity Face Matcher**, a cutting-edge project that empowers individuality by matching your facial image to a celebrity look-alike. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models for face detection, alignment, and embedding extraction, this system not only boosts self-confidence but also paves the way for interactive, real-time storytelling experiences.

## üåü Overview

**Celebrity Face Matcher** is designed to demonstrate that everyone has a unique, star-quality look. It processes user-uploaded images to detect, align, and generate facial embeddings. These embeddings are then compared against a pre-populated database of celebrity embeddings (using a managed vector database‚ÄîPinecone) to find the top matching celebrities. Additionally, a natural language explanation module (planned for future iterations) will provide personalized feedback on why you match with a particular celebrity.

## üéØ Vision

Our mission is to:
- **Empower Individuality**: Show users that every face is unique and special.
- **Boost Self-Confidence**: Help users see themselves as the stars they are.
- **Democratize Celebrity Culture**: Break traditional barriers by demonstrating that anyone can resemble a celebrity.
- **Real-Time Storytelling**: Lay the groundwork for an interactive cinematic experience where users can turn everyday life into a dynamic story.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12+**: The primary programming language used throughout the project.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
    - **MTCNN**: For robust face detection and landmark extraction.
    - **InceptionResnetV1**: For generating 512-dimensional facial embeddings (pre-trained on VGGFace2).
- **Vector Database**:
    - **Pinecone**: A managed vector database service used to store and query high-dimensional facial embeddings using cosine similarity.
- **Database**:
    - **MongoDB Atlas**: Stores celebrity metadata and image paths. We ingest a subset of the CelebA dataset for this purpose.
- **APIs and Tools**:
    - **Kaggle API**: Used to download the CelebA dataset from Kaggle.
    - **FastAPI/Flask (Planned)**: For future deployment as a web service.
    - **PyTorch**: Used for deep learning model inference.
- **Other Libraries**:
    - **OpenCV**: For image reading, processing, and visualization.
    - **Pandas**: For CSV file processing.
    - **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Pipeline

The project is organized into several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
     - The `app/data/celeba_ingestion.py` module downloads a subset of the CelebA dataset using the Kaggle API, processes the attribute CSV files, and stores celebrity records (including a local image path, simulated name, and age) in MongoDB.

2. **Image Processing Pipeline**:
     - The `app/image_processing/` package includes modules for:
         - **Face Detection (`face_detector.py`)**: Uses MTCNN to locate faces in an image.
         - **Face Alignment (`face_aligner.py`)**: Aligns detected faces based on facial landmarks.
         - **Embedding Extraction (`face_encoder.py`)**: Extracts a 512-dimensional embedding from an aligned face using a pre-trained model.
         - **Pipeline Orchestration (`run_pipeline.py`)**: Integrates the above steps, creates composite images for visualization, and saves outputs.

3. **Vector Storage**:
     - The `app/vector_store/pinecone_client.py` module handles:
         - **Index Initialization**: Automatically creates or connects to a Pinecone index.
         - **Upserting Embeddings**: Inserts (or updates) celebrity embeddings along with metadata.
         - **Querying**: Allows for similarity search based on a user‚Äôs query embedding.

4. **Query & Inference**:
     - The `app/query/query_pipeline.py` module takes a user image, processes it through the image pipeline to obtain an embedding, and queries the Pinecone index to retrieve the top 5 similar celebrity embeddings. It also composes a composite result image showing the query image alongside the top matches.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- MongoDB Atlas account (for storing celebrity data)
- Pinecone account (for vector storage)
- Kaggle account (with API credentials)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/maxhartml/Celebrity-Face-Matcher.git
     cd Celebrity-Face-Matcher
     ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
     ```sh
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
     Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following (replace placeholder values with your actual credentials):
     ```env
     # MongoDB
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     MONGODB_DB_NAME=celebrityDB
     MONGODB_COLLECTION=celebrities

     # Pinecone
     PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
     PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=celebrity-embeddings
     PINECONE_CLOUD=aws
     PINECONE_REGION=us-east-1

     # Kaggle (for dataset ingestion)
     # Ensure you have your kaggle.json file in ~/.kaggle/
     CELEBA_DATASET_ID=jessicali9530/celeba-dataset
     CELEBA_OUTPUT_DIR=./celeba_data
     ```

5. **Set Up Kaggle Credentials**:
     Follow Kaggle‚Äôs instructions to place your `kaggle.json` file in `~/.kaggle/` or set the `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

## üöÄ Usage

### Data Ingestion

To download and ingest a subset of the CelebA dataset into MongoDB, run:
```sh
python -m app.data.celeba_ingestion
```
This script will download the dataset (if not already present), parse the attribute CSV file, and insert the top 100 celebrity records into MongoDB.
### Running the Image Processing Pipeline

To process all celebrity records from the database, extract their embeddings, and store them in Pinecone, run:

```sh
python -m app.orchestration.orchestrator
```

This module retrieves records from MongoDB, downloads each celebrity image (using a local file path), processes the images through the pipeline, and upserts the embeddings (with metadata) into the Pinecone vector store.

### Querying the Pinecone Index

To query the Pinecone index with an image and retrieve the top 5 matching celebrity embeddings, run:
```sh
python -m app.query.query_pipeline /path/to/your/test_image.jpg
```
This will:
- Process the image through the pipeline.
- Query the Pinecone index using the extracted embedding.
- Compose and save a composite result image (which shows the query image alongside the top 5 matching images) in `images/results`.
